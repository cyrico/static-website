This website was made with plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Flask framework for server side handling. It uses SQLite3 for the database that holds all the users and orders.  

This is my first website built from scratch, and so I decided to not use frameworks like React in order for me to learn the fundamentals myself. It is definitely rough around the edges and I underutilized JavaScript, but overall it was fun to make and I learned quite a bit.
